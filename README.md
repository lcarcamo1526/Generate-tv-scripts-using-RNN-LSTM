# Generate Seinfeld scripts using RNN-LSTM and Word Embeddings
Generate tv scripts or dialogs using Seinfeld scripts database using AI


## Project Overview
This network is going to generate Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. it will be using a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network will generate a new, "fake" TV script.
